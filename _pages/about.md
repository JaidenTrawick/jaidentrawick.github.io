Hi, I'm an IT professional and hobbyist developer/artist. I'm also a Storyteller for the World of Darkness 5th edition games--you may be looking for my [Hunter: the Reckoning](/h5-dice-roller/) or [Werewolf: the Apocalypse](/w5-dice-roller/) dice rollers.

Right now, I'm creating a multiplayer strategy game by myself. Expect dev blogs soon!
